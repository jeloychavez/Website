        - title : 2. Why is the blog in Spanish? 🤔
          description : Because I want to contribute to the Spanish-speaking community. 
                        I think there are many resources in English (which is great)
                        compared to those in Spanish.
                        This language difference may limits a lot of people who only speak Spanish.
